    \textbf{Abstract}

An abstract is quite different from an introduction. It is a summary of the report, in which you include one sentence (or so) for every main section of your report. For example, you can include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the context of the research
\item
the purpose of the report
\item
the major findings (you may need several sentences here)
\item
the conclusions
\item
the main recommendations
\end{enumerate}
Write the abstract after you have written the report.
